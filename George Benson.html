            <p id="benson-hidden1" class="hidden bubble">A few years into our relationship, Gabby and I started a shared playlist of songs simply called “happy songs!” It must’ve been after we watched the movie <em>Stepmom</em>, because the playlist opens with “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”  (1/5)</p>
            <p id="benson-hidden2" class="hidden bubble">Over several years, we kept adding songs one at a time until it was over 50 songs long. I can’t really explain the criteria for what made it onto the playlist, beyond saying that I think George Benson’s “Turn Your Love Around” would’ve been in there. (2/5)</p>
            <p id="benson-hidden3" class="hidden bubble">This playlist was essential to us because these were not just happy songs, but happy songs <em>to us</em>. We were <a href="Durutti Column.html">the only audience</a> for that playlist — that is, until we got married, when many of the songs made it into our wedding playlist. (3/5)</p>
            <p id="benson-hidden4" class="hidden bubble">But “happy songs!” was a precursor to all that, or more like <a href="Air.html">a vehicle</a> for starting to think that way, of us <a href="Jana Horn.html">as a unit</a>. (4/5)</p>
            <p id="benson-hidden5" class="hidden bubble">Like when we bought a shitty projector in college and celebrated because we saw it as our first major purchase (read: >$100) together. (5/5)</p>
