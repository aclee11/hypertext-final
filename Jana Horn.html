            <p id="horn-hidden1" class="hidden bubble">I learned to waltz in a school play in 6th grade, around the same time I got my first real crush — which, true to its name, crushed me. (1/4)</p>
            <p id="horn-hidden2" class="hidden bubble">That chaos of the body and brain grasped for any semblance of order, and it found it in the <a href="Irma Thomas.html">steady 1-2-3</a> of the waltz. To my ears, ¾ will always be a <a href="George Benson.html">romantic time</a> signature. (2/4)</p>
            <p id="horn-hidden3" class="hidden bubble">In the case of Jana Horn’s “Leaving Him,” the romance is not a shout — look at the song title, after all — but a whisper: the timid kiss of the drumstick on <a href="Extremely Bad Man.html">the hi-hat</a>, the gauzy vibraphone, the way Horn softens around the letter “t.” (3/4)</p>
            <p id="horn-hidden4" class="hidden bubble">As if not to disturb someone while they sleep. (4/4)</p>
