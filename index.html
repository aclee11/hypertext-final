            <p id="hidden-element1" class="hidden">Kids my age were born too late to make mixtapes, so instead we burned CDs—a subversive act of Promethean proportion that put the power of creation in our hands.</p>
            <p id="hidden-element2" class="hidden">(At least for the 74 minutes a single CD-R could hold.)</p>
            <p id="hidden-element3" class="hidden">Then came the important work of naming: Some scrawled haphazard liner notes in Sharpie across the CD's face; others slid, with a painstaking, surgical precision, the tip of an X-Acto knife along its reflective surface. Either way, we made our mark.</p>
            <p id="hidden-element4" class="hidden">The CD carried our fingerprints, its data our DNA.</p>

            <p>In the spirit of those lovingly burned CDs, the songs in this hyper-playlist are more than just tracks — they are time capsules, charged with memory. <br><br>As you move between songs, audio will automatically play, so headphones are encouraged.</p>
