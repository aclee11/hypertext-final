            <p id="air-hidden1" class="hidden bubble">Of his creative process, the poet John Ashbery once said, “I feel that poetry is going on all the time inside, an <a href="test123">underground stream</a>. One can let down one's bucket and bring the poem back up.”</p>
            <p id="air-hidden2" class="hidden bubble">Naturally, it was my older siblings who picked the music as they schlepped me along Vermont's back roads to playdates and rec league soccer games. There was Depeche Mode, Fischerspooner, The Blow, so many others…</p>
            <p id="air-hidden3" class="hidden bubble">…and Air. I latched on quick to Air and haven't let go since.</p>
            <p id="air-hidden4" class="hidden bubble">For all the time I've spent with Air's music, the band still surprises me. This song—the last on Moon Safari—fades in with <a href="test123">a funhouse</a> of jumbled, echoing piano melodies.</p>
