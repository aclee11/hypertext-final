            <p id="air-hidden1" class="hidden bubble">Of his creative process, the poet John Ashbery once said, “I feel that poetry is going on all the time inside, an <a href="Extremely Bad Man.html">underground</a> stream. One can let down one's bucket and bring the poem back up.” (1/5)</p>
            <p id="air-hidden2" class="hidden bubble">Naturally, it was my older siblings who picked the music as they schlepped me along Vermont's back roads to playdates and rec league soccer games. There was Depeche Mode, Fischerspooner, The Blow, so many others… (2/5)</p>
            <p id="air-hidden3" class="hidden bubble">…and Air. I latched on quick to Air and <a href="Durutti Column.html">haven't let go</a> since. (3/5)</p>
            <p id="air-hidden4" class="hidden bubble">For all the time I've spent with Air's music, the band still surprises me. This song — the last on <em>Moon Safari</em> — fades in with a funhouse of jumbled, echoing piano melodies. (4/5)</p>
            <p id="air-hidden5" class="hidden bubble">Then, come 0:38, these two <em>mecs</em> let down their bucket and pull up one of the <a href="George Benson.html">slickest grooves</a> they've ever made. (5/5)</p>
