            <p id="extremely-hidden1" class="hidden bubble">This is one of those songs Spotify always wants me to listen to. (1/6)</p>
            <p id="extremely-hidden2" class="hidden bubble">I don’t know why — this song came out 5 years ago and the group hasn’t made any new music since. By all accounts, they're defunct, or at least in deep hibernation. (2/6)</p>
            <p id="extremely-hidden3" class="hidden bubble">Maybe the group will resurface just when Spotify’s forgotten about them, like the cicadas who <a href="Jana Horn.html">sleep</a> underground for 17 years... (3/6)</p>
            <p id="extremely-hidden4" class="hidden bubble">...until that one fateful moment they <a href="Irma Thomas.html">break free from the soil</a>, fly south, frantically mate, and die. (4/6)</p>
            <p id="extremely-hidden5" class="hidden bubble">As it turns out, the cicada is engineered to make sound. Its membranes can rub against its ribs to click and buzz, while the chambers of its body are shaped like concert halls to reverberate sound. (5/6)</p>
            <p id="extremely-hidden6" class="hidden bubble">Little do we know, they’re putting on <a href="George Benson.html">a show for us</a>. (6/6)</p>
